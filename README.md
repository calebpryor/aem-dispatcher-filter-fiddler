# aem-dispatcher-filter-fiddler

A basic HTML/JS page that allows you to paste in a HTTP Request with the method to auto-generate a AEM dispatcher module filter rule to allow traffic to reach AEM.  It helps give people syntax examples to build better rules.

`Keep in mind that you can write much better rules than this can generate.  This is a learning tool not a production rule generator do your own testing!`

# How to use

Open dispatcher-filter-fiddler.html in your favorite browser and either type in or paste in one or a few requests you'd like to generate a sample syntax of a filter for and it will automatically generate this rule in the lower field
